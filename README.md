# mojoPortal Languages Support

All non-EN-US languages are in this repository.

Languages are organized by their IETF Language Tag. To use a language, download this repository and copy the contents of the language you need into the root of your mojoPortal installation. If you do not see your language below, please consider helping by providing a translation.

We need translators for this project. If you are fluent in a language other than English and you use mojoPortal, please consider helping.
